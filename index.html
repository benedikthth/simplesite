    <h1>Benedikt H. Thordarson</h1>

    <p>

            I am a 2018 graduate from Reykjavik University's
            computer science bachelor's program.
            
            I am born in 1993, raised in Rekjavik Iceland.
            For fun, I make things; games,
            art, food, electronics and more.
            
            I have work experience ranging from waiting tables, selling timber,
            to programming interface tests.
            
            
            I am currently enrolled in Reykjavik University's master's program,
            focusing on IoT, computer networks, and network security.

    <p>
        
            I spend most of my time working on school
            projects and whatever free time I have left I 
            spend on my hobbies. 
            I particularly like cooking and regularly try to challenge
            myself in the kitchen. I especially love to make 
            steaks, roast, and chicken. On my 25. birthday I was 
            introduced to homebrewing and that has been a hobby 
            mine of ever since.
            <br /><br />
            
            
            I also am a fan of DIY projects, especially 
            when I can connect the outcome to another part 
            of my interests. For example, I made an IoT 
            temperature monitor to keep track of the 
            fermentation process.
            I went through the process of creating a front- 
            and backend for this system as well as a rudimentary 
            future forecast of temperature.
            <br /><br />

            I paint and draw regularly. In highschool I 
            took every arts class I could, and did very well.
            My favorite medium changes frequently but I am 
            proficient in pencils and acrylics.
            <br /><br />

            I am a massive sci-fi geek - I have a specific 
            fascination with space - and thus I love star wars, star trek , 
            video games such as Eve online, and Stellaris even though 
            I have little time for gaming during my master's studies.
