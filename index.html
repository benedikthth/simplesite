    <h1>Benedikt H. Thordarson</h1>


    <p>
        I am a 2018 graduate from Reykjavik University's
        computer science bachelor's program. I am born in 1993, raised in Rekjavik Iceland.
        For fun, I make things; games, art, food, electronics and more.
    </p>
    <p>    
        I am currently enrolled in Reykjavik University's master's program.
        My master's project is classifying obstructive apnea in individual respiratory cycles. 
        During my master's project I developed a Breath Segmentation Algorithm that achieves 94% accuracy.
        My classifier used machine learning to classify breaths as either normal or obstructed with as high as 93% accuracy.
        Over my master's studies I had the opportunity to dive deep into unrelated fields within computer science, 
        such as the IoT and game design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been a teaching assistant for Reykjavik University's computer networks since 2017, a course that is immensely 
        demanding in terms of both students and instructors. My work on computer networks included student instruction, lecturing, 
        course material design, and project grading.
    </p> 
    <p> 
        I also had the opportunity to TA a computer security course in 2021, which was to a certain extent a pilot course within the
        university since it not only put an emphasis on teaching the tools that a hacker is likely to posess, but also in intrusion detection
        and hardening. I was responsible for grading student projects, advising on final projects, designing intentionally vulnerable machines
        for penetration testing, and lecturing.
    </p>

    <p>
        
        I spend most of my time working on school
        projects and whatever free time I have left I 
        spend on my hobbies. 
        I particularly like cooking and regularly try to challenge
        myself in the kitchen. I especially love to make 
        steaks, roast, and chicken. On my 25th birthday I was 
        introduced to homebrewing and that has been a hobby 
        mine of ever since.
        <br /><br />
        
        
        I also am a fan of DIY projects, especially 
        when I can connect the outcome to another part 
        of my interests. For example, I made an IoT 
        temperature monitor to keep track of the 
        fermentation process in my homebrewing project.
        I went through the process of creating a front- 
        and backend for this system as well as a rudimentary 
        future forecast of temperature.
        <br /><br />

        I paint and draw regularly. In highschool I 
        took every arts class I could, and did very well.
        My favorite medium changes frequently but I am 
        proficient in pencils and acrylics.
        <br /><br />

        I am a massive sci-fi geek - I have a specific 
        fascination with space - and thus I love star wars, star trek<!--Kirk best captain, Picard close second-->, 
        video games such as Eve online, and Stellaris even though 
        I have little time for gaming during my master's studies.

    </p>
