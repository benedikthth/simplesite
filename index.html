    <h1>Benedikt H. Thordarson</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my personal website. I am a recently graduate from 
        Reykjavik University's computer science program. 

        I am currently enrolled in Reykjavik University's master's 
        program, focusing on IoT, computer networks, and network 
        security.

    <p>
        I am a computer scientist, born in 1993, raised in
        Rekjavik Iceland.
        
        For fun, I make games, art, food, things and more.
        <br />

        I particularly like cooking, and I regularly try to 
        challenge myself in the kitchen. This extends to more 
        in esoteric culinary activities, such as homebrewing.
        <br />

        I also am a fan of DiY projects, especially when I can 
        connect the outcome to another part of my interests. 
        For example, I made a IoT temperature monitor for keeping
        track of fermentation process. I went through the process
        of creating a front and backend for this system, as well
        as a rudimentary future forecast of temperature.
        <br />

        I am a massive sci-fi geek, I have a specific fascination
        with space, and thus I love star wars, star trek 
        <!-- Favorite captain is Picard. Kirk #2 -->, video games 
        such as Eve online, and Stellaris, even though I have little
        time for gaming during my master's studies.
