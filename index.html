    <h1>Benedikt H. Thordarson</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my personal website. I am a recent graduate from 
        Reykjavik University's computer science program. 
        <br />

        I am currently enrolled in Reykjavik University's master's 
        program, focusing on IoT, computer networks, and network 
        security.

        <br />
        I spend most of my time working on school projects, with 
        whatever free time I have, I spend on my hobbies.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a computer scientist, born in 1993, raised in
        Rekjavik Iceland.
        
        For fun, I make things; games, art, food, electronics and more.
        <br /><br />

        I particularly like cooking, and I regularly try to 
        challenge myself in the kitchen. I especially love 
        to make steaks, roast, and chicken.

        On my 25. birthday, I was introduced to homebrewing
        and that has been a hobby mine of since then.
        
        <br /><br />

        I also am a fan of DIY projects, especially when I can 
        connect the outcome to another part of my interests. 
        For example, I made a IoT temperature monitor for keeping
        track of fermentation process. I went through the process
        of creating a front, and backend for this system, as well
        as a rudimentary future forecast of temperature.
        <br /><br />

        I paint and draw regularly. During my highschool I took
        every arts class I could, and did very well. My favorite 
        medium changes frequently, but I am proficient in pencils
        and acrylics.
        <br /><br />

        I am a massive sci-fi geek, I have a specific fascination
        with space, and thus I love star wars, star trek
        <!-- Favorite captain is Picard. Kirk is a close second -->, video games 
        such as Eve online, and Stellaris, even though I have little
        time for gaming during my master's studies.
